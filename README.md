### Summary â€“ 
As part of the final project of the AI-1 course at Univ.AI, we trained and tuned models like 
<ul>
<li>KNN,
<li>Logistic Regression, 
<li>Random Forest and
<li>XGBoost <br>
to predict whether the customer is satisfied or unsatisfied.  <br>
Before modelling, we pre-processed the data, did feature selection using feature engine library in python and resampled the data using SMOTE as the target class was highly imbalanced.
