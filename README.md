# Santander_Customer_Satisfaction
Binary classification task to identify unsatisfied customers for a business. Summary â€“ As part of the final project of the AI-1 course at Univ.AI, we trained and tuned models like KNN, logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost to predict whether the customer is satisfied or unsatisfied.  Before modelling, we pre-processed the data, did feature selection using feature engine library in python and resampled the data using SMOTE as the target class was highly imbalanced.
